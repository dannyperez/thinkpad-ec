Much of this is educated guesswork from the observed steps, but it might
provide a starting point for further investigation.  Some of it could also
be just plain wrong.  

My current understanding on how the EC flash process (as opposed to
the BIOS one) works are as follows:

    1) dosflash loads firmware and does some validations
    2) dosflash writes firmware to a specific location in the BIOS flash
       (possibly just by handing the firmware blob to a BIOS call)
    3) dosflash reboots the machine
    4) during the BIOS Power-On-Self-Test, the BIOS notices that there
       is a EC firmware in that special area and starts the flash process
    5) The BIOS may or may not do some verification on the firmware before
       allowing it to be sent to the EC
    6) The BIOS tells the EC firmware to go into firmware update mode
    7) The old EC firmware receives the new firmware data, performing
       decryption on some of it as it goes and flashing it into the flash
       memory onboard the EC chip.
    8) When the old EC firmware has finished receiving the new firmware,
       it sends itself a reset signal and reboots into the new EC firmware.
    9) The BIOS gets confirmation from the EC that it is back up and running
       and allows the boot sequence to continue.
